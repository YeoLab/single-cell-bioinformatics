    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "A line beginning with a dollar sign (`$`) indicates the command line. It is meant to orient you that the command is to be performed in the terminal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $ \n",
    "    \n",
    "This is not to be confused with something like `$HOME`, which means a variable named \"HOME\" that has the value (on my computer), shown by `echo` (which prints the output of commands). The dollar sign here means to access that variable. The line after the command line means the output of the command.\n",

    "### Anatomy of a Unix command\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using unix commands here and it's worth pausing and talking about what these commands are really doing. Let's pretend we have a program called `libraryprep`. We can call the program using its name:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ libraryprep\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's say it has the option flag (aka \"flag\" aka \"argument\") `--stranded`. You'd tell the program this flag by putting it after the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ libraryprep --stranded\n",
    "    \n",
    "A lot of times there's a shortened version of the flag. For `--stranded` let's say it's `-s`. Then you could use the shorter command,\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -s  # This is equal to \"libraryprep --stranded\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the hash \"`#`\". In all the languages we'll be using (bash, Python), this is a \"comment\" meaning its only for human reading and the computer can stop reading as soon as it sees the hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a flag requires an input, you would put it immediately after the flag. For example, say we have a flag called `--input` and it requires the cell lysis file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -s --input lysis\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now Let's say it has the options `-a`, `-s`, `-d`, `-f` We can put all of them sequentially:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -a -s -d -f\n",
    "    \n",
    "Or put them all in a row after a single dash. So the above command is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -asdf\n",
    "    \n",
    "But if you have a multi-character flag like `--stranded` then that has to be separate:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -adf --stranded  # correct\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -adfstranded     # incorrect\n",
    "    \n",
    "Or if the flag requires an argument, then you have to keep it separate, unless the shortened version is at the end. For the purposes of this, let's say `-i` is short for `--input`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -asdf --input lysis  # correct\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -asdfi lysis         # correct\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -asdfinput lysis     # incorrect\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -asdif lysis         # incorrect\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a long command, you can separate it out onto multiple lines for readability (meaning just for you the human, not for the computer) by using the backslash \"`\\`\" for each line that's supposed to continue on to the next one. The indentation is purely for readability and isn't required - it just looks nicer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fun fact: The way I remember that \"`\\`\" backslash because the top is falling backwards, and \"`/`\" is frontslash because the top is falling forwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ # Correct\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -adf \\\n",
    "        --input lysis \\\n",
    "        --stranded\n",
    "\n",
    " It is very important that there are no spaces or other characters after the slashes! Otherwise your program will throw a cryptic syntax error and you will be sad.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ # Incorrect\n",
    "    $ libraryprep -adf \\ # comments aren't allowed here\n",
    "        --input lysis \\ --flags-arent-okay-either\n",
    "        --stranded\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting help\n",
    "\n",
    "For most command-line programs, you can get help on how to actually use the program one of four ways. This is called finding the \"usage\" message. I've written them in priority order so, try the first one first, then the second, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `$ programname`\n",
    "    2. Without any arguments, this will call the program. Sometimes this will give you usage information, sometimes it will result in an error.\n",
    "2. `$ programname -h`\n",
    "    3. The `-h` is (generally) a universal short version flag for \"help me!!! I don't know what's going on!!\" Though sometimes that doesn't work either ...\n",
    "3. `$ programname --help`\n",
    "    4. The expanded version of `-h`\n",
    "4. `$ man programname`\n",
    "    5. `man` is for \"manual\" and will bring up the manual pages for that command\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subcommands\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programs we'll use will have subcommands. This means that we're calling a specific subprogram of a single program. For example, let's pretend we have a program called `microscopy`, and it has the subcommands `brightfield` and `fluorescence`. You wouldn't be able to call just `microscopy` by itself, because you need to specify the exact subprogram (in this analogy, the type of light inputs) that you want to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ microscopy\n",
    "    Error: Must specify either \"brightfield\" or \"fluorescence\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be flags like `--zoom` that would make sense for both subcommands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ microscopy brightfield --zoom 10x\n",
    "    \n",
    "But only for the `fluorescence` subcommand does the flag `--wavelength` make any sense, since `brightfield` would show all the light.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $ microscopy fluorescence --wavelength 488 --zoom 10x\n",
    "    \n",
    "### \"Standard in\" and \"standard out\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these commands use the greater than (`>`), which means that the output of the program should be saved a file. I like to think of it as the big input (the left side of the `>`) being squeezed into the small corner of the arrow (right side of the `>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's go back to our `libraryprep` example. We tell the `libraryprep` program we want a stranded library with our `lysis` input, and to save it as the file called `cdna`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ libraryprep --stranded --input lysis > cdna\n",
