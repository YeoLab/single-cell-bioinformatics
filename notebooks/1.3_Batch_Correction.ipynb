    "# Batch correction\n",
    "\n",
    "What is batch correction? A \"Batch\" is when experiments have been performed at different times and there's some obvious difference between them. Single-cell experiments are often inherently \"batchy\" because you can only perform so many single cell captures at once, and you do multiple captures, over different days, with different samples. How do you correct for the technical noise without deleting the true biological signal?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Avoiding batch effects\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, it's best to design your experiments to minimize batch effects. For example, if you can mix your samples such that there are multiple representations of samples per single-cell capture, then this will help because you will have representations of both biological and technical variance across batches, rather than BOTH biological and technical variance.\n",

    "![Don't confound your biological and technical variance](figures/batch_effects-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, when you try to correct for batch effects between captures, it's impossible to know whether you're removing the technical noise of the different captures, or the biological signal of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good: Technical variance is different from biological variance\n",
    "The idea here is that you would ahead of time, mix the cells from your samples in equal proportions and then perform cell capture on the mixed samples, so you would get different technical batches, but they wouldn't be counfounded by the biological signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Spread your biological signal across technical replicates](figures/batch_effects-02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, when you correct for batch effects, the technical batches and biological signals are separate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If it's completely impossible to do multiple biological samples in the same technical replicate...\n",

    "For example, if you have to harvest your cells at parcticular timepoints, here are some ways that you can try to mitigate the batch effects:\n",

    "### Sample-batchy\n",
    "\n",
    "This is when you have groups of samples that may have some biological difference between them, but also have technical differences between them. Say, you performed single-cell capture on several different days from different mice, of somewhat overlapping ages. You know that you have the biological signal from the different mice and the different ages, but you *also* have the technical signal from the different batches. BUT there's no getting around that you had to sacrifice the mice and collect their cells in one batch\n",
